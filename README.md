# Tenon / 榫卯

Tenon is a modern low-code editor for **Cross-Frameworks**, **Cross-Platforms** (will be support in the future).

Tenon extract the logic outside the core editor to ```@tenon/workbench``` , and data model to ```@tenon/engine```, so you can use it to build different data-structure based editor, and multi render based material to ```@tenon/materials```, so you can use it to render in different frameworks.

You can experience the modern editor by **```pnpm run dev```** in ```apps/tenon-editor``` which is developing.

Tenon has a long way to go, and it's still in the early stages of development. If you are interested in this project, please join us.

> Tenon has a legacy version, which is only support VueJS and has an ugly design. 
> But it's still available, you can try it by 
**```pnpm run legacy:dev:mix```**. 
> required local environment: ```pnpm```, ```mongodb```, ```nodejs``` 
> sorry for without Docker support, as I mentioned, it is a legacy version and has an ugly design :(
