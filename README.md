# Tenon / 榫卯

Tenon is a modern low-code editor for cross-frameworks and cross-platforms (which will be supported in the future).

Tenon extracts the logic outside the core editor to @tenon/workbench and the data model to @tenon/engine. This allows you to use it to build different data-structure-based editors and multi-renderer-based materials to @tenon/material-foundation. Thus, you can use it to render in different frameworks.

To experience the modern editor, you can run `pnpm run dev` in `apps/tenon-editor`, where it is currently being developed.

Tenon still has a long way to go and is still in the early stages of development. If you are interested in this project, please join us.

> There is also a legacy version of Tenon, which only supports VueJS and has an outdated design. However, it is still available for use. You can try it by running `pnpm run legacy:dev:mix`. Please note that the legacy version requires a local environment with pnpm, MongoDB, and Node.js. Unfortunately, Docker support is not available for the legacy version, as mentioned earlier. Apologies for the inconvenience caused by the outdated design :(.
