      This file is used to help the UnoCSS compiler to detect the component.
      You can add any rule you want to load in runtime here.

      As a side note: UnoCSS will auto detect the rule you used in sfc
      but will not auto detect the rule you used in js/ts file. So if you
      want to use a rule in js/ts file, you need to add it here.
